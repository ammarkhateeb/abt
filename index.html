        <p>Yesterday, I met Javeed Bhai...</p>
        <p>He moves around Vaniyambadi on a small, makeshift skateboard He moves around Vaniyambadi on a small, makeshift skateboard, pushing himself forward with his hands. He had polio when he was four, and since then, this has been his only way to get around. He lives near Khaide Millat, close to Kousia Masjid in Talab Kotta, Tirupattur, in a small house that barely holds his family. But he comes to Vaniyambadi almost every day. I asked him why, and he smiled, "Yaan waley bina puche madad karte."</p>
